        <u>Example 1: Producing for a grocery store</u>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Producing for a grocery store by farming crops is a big benefit for the community, and can give you a lot of service hours if you're not being paid. Resources you need are farming tools(shovel, hoe, etc.), watering can, seeds, and you need enough space for farmland.

        <u>Example 2: Programming an SAE research site(My SAE you are currently viewing now)</u>
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Programming an SAE research page is in a technologic level of SAE. All you need is a broadband internet connection, a tool for coding(One that supports HTML), and basic HTML skills. HTML is a code language used to make websites, and intergrates website info in apps programmed in other languages. When programming an SAE research site, be sure to add examples and explain the different types of SAEs.</p>
